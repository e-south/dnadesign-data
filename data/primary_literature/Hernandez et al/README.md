# Promoter and non-promoter sequences
Sequences curated by Hernandez et al. 2022. They developed a CNN-based classifier, which was benchmarked on experimentally verified promoter sequences and non-promoter ones extracted from coding zones. They are part of RegulonDB version 9.3, in which each entry has 81 bp.
